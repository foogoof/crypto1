;;; # Notes for Coursera Cryptography I by Dan Boneh
;;; 
;;; ## What is cryptography?
;;; 
;; **

;; **
;;; Two main goals of cryptography are:
;;; 
;;;   * secure key establishment
;;;   * secure communication
;; **

;; **
;;; Some uses of cryptography include:
;;; 
;;;   * digital signatures
;;;   * anonymous communication (mix net)
;;;   * anonymous digital cash
;;;   * elections
;;;   * private auctions like the [Vickery auction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vickrey_auction)
;;;   * secure multiparty communication
;; **

;; **
;;; ### BAD: trusted authority
;;; ### BETTER: peer to peer verification
;;; 
;;; Theorem: anything that can be done with a trusted authority can also be done without.
;; **

;; **
;;; ### Crypto magic
;;; 
;;; * privately outsourcing computation
;;;   - receiving encrypted results based on encrypted criteria... search engine has no knowledge of criteria
;;; * zero knowledge (proof of knowledge)
;;; 
;;; Given two large primes `p` and `q` and their product `N`:
;;; 
;;; * Alice knows `p` and `q` and `N`
;;; * Bob knows `N`
;;; * Alice can prove to Bob she knows `p` and `q` without disclosing them
;;;

;; **
;;; ### Cryptography is a rigorous science
;;; 
;;; This course takes these steps:
;;; 
;;; 1. Precisely specify the threat model
;;; 2. Propose a construction
;;; 3. Prove that breaking the construction under the threat model will solve an underlying hard problem
